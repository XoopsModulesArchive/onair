echo "<p>Culex On-air was originally build as a radio related script to run a rotator showing who is currently on-air, the radio staions name, the title of the show, when it started, when it will end, show picture of the dj and what song he is currently playing.</p>
<p>Now it has progressed a little to be included in a 2-parted container / scroller showing also the same information about what will come just after current event. Also you can click the front rotators image to move on and see the details of this event in a separate page.</p>
<p>As I was working and rewriting the module from the older version, I descided to include also the ability to add playlists to every independent show, and I hope I acomplished this ok.</p>
<p>Later I discovered this module can be used to many other things, not just radio shows. </p>
<p>It could serve also nicely as a banner rotator with the details shoing more info about the client, or showing movies playing in a theater, concerts currently playing somewhere, maybe event churches could use this to show events cumming up or in progress.... Use as you like actually :)<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Installation</strong><br />
  ------------</p>
<p>1)	upload the onair folder to your XOOPS_ROOT/modules/<br />
  and install as a normal module.</p>
<p>2)	Go to preferences and set up you timeformat (12 hours / 24 hours).<br />
  Dont use both formats. The script gets confused as it only understands ONE time type at the ...well time.<br />
  3) set up the paths for plugins, imagepath, image size etc etc, and your ready to roll.</p>
<p>4) Choose ADD new to fill out infor about your show and choose already uploaded images for the event + plugins<br />
  used by you station. A good idea would be to upload the images first and the Add new.</p>

  Default is Now Playing (winamp) and for DireTTore </p>
